      <description>I recently tried to learn an array programming language. APL seemed to be the most famous one with J but I did not like the ASCII and the most used APL did not have a license I wanted to work with. I found BQN and it checked all I wanted! However, BQN is a very young language still being developped and while the documentation is comprehensive it is still a bit rough (in my opinion)for beginners.</description>
