APL seemed to be the most famous one with J but I did not like the ASCII and the most used APL did not have a license I wanted to work with. I found BQN and it checked all I wanted! However, BQN is a very young language still being developped and while the documentation is comprehensive it is still a bit rough (in my opinion)for beginners. I want to write a simple introduction to BQN that I would have like to have when I began. This is the first post of a serie.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am still a beginner and I may write incorrect things.</p>
<p>I will base this post on <a href="https://github.com/thibaultbarbie/bqn-planner">a recent program I made</a>. Here is an exert:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>DistSqr ← {+´2⋆˜𝕨-𝕩}
</code></pre><p>This code defines a function named <code>DistSqr</code> which compute the squared euclidian distance.
To create a function you need to use <code>←</code>. Important, in BQN all user-defined functions have to begin with a capital letter. I often forgot it and BQN will complain about it.</p>
<p>In BQN you either define a function as <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/tacit.html">tacit</a> or explicitly within <a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/doc/block.html">blocks</a>. In my code I only used blocks <code>{}</code> because it is easier to program than tacitly.
A function in BQN can take a left argument 𝕨 and a right argument 𝕩. For example, we could define a (useless) addition function as:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Addition ← {𝕨+𝕩}
</code></pre><p>You can use multiple time the arguments inside the function, for example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Triple ← {𝕩+𝕩+𝕩}
</code></pre><p>However, using multiple time the same arguments may require a lot of parenthesis. For example, let say that a function $$a^5+\sum i$$</p>
